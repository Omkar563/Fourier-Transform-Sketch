# Fourier-Transform-Sketch
This is a program written in Java script to Sketch any user drawn loop by using epicycles and Fourier Transform

## Javascript Library Used:
I have used p5.js which is a library in javascript used for animation and processing.

## Mathematics Involved :

I have used Fourier Transform to make this project.

The Fourier Transform is a basic tool used to math to decompose functions into arbitrary ones. This has a wide variety of uses such as in image compression and processing, sound engineering and so on.

I have also used epicycles in correspondence to the Fourier Transform in order to trace any path drawn by the user.
